## Purpose

It checks the SSL certificate for a site and reports the expiration date.

## Why?

A coworker and I were dorking around one day and came up with the idea. Thought it would be fun to write.

## Where The Magic Happens

In `lib/site.rb` -- everything else is 100% stock Rails stuff.

## TODO

* Tests for `lib/site.rb`
* Slicker UI.
* Probably more features if someone asks.
